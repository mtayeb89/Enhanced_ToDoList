To-Do List App
# Overview

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application written in Python. The app allows users to manage tasks by adding, listing, deleting, and marking them as completed. Tasks are saved to a file, making them persistent across sessions.
# Features

    Add Tasks: Add a task with a priority level (High, Medium, Low) and a due date.
    List Tasks: View all current tasks with their priority, due date, and completion status.
    Delete Tasks: Remove a task from the list.
    Mark Tasks as Completed: Mark tasks as completed and keep track of their status.
    Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved to a file (tasks.json), so they persist even when the app is closed.
